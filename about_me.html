                    My name is Padma Christie, and Iâ€™m passionate about teaching English. 
                    Since elementary school, English was always the subject that I had the 
                    most interest and consistently did well in. This led me to getting my 
                    first teaching job at Joy English School and being part of an
                    English teaching project during my time in university. I loved 
                    seeing my students progress and grow more confident in their
                    English which confirmed even more why I love teaching.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides teaching, I have a really big love for music. I play the
                    guitar, violin, sing and like to relax with some bossa nova. I 
                    love traveling and would like to visit Thailand one day and go biking
                    around the entirety of Taiwan in the future. I also have a soft
                    spot for animals and have a pet turtle named GuiGui.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope that I can realize my dreams and I look forward to sharing more 
                    of my journey.
                </p>
